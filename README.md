  BetterBooru *(currently mis-stylized as 'BetterBoruu' in all instances&mdash;I'll fix that eventually if I don't come up with a more unique name)* is an alternative frontend for most boorus that I designed for fun and for utility.

  This is currently a huge work-in-progress; nothing is finished by any means. Having to use [the web version of VSCode](<https://vscode.dev>) a lot of the time, I can't actually make commits on their own; I have to commit *and* push, which publishes the saved version immediately. If you come across a version of the website that doesn't function properly or looks like a work in progress, that's probably why.

  This is also my first GitHub project, let alone my first GitHub Pages project, so combined with the VSCode issue, things are bound to screw up one way or another while I use it. Please let me know if anything goes wrong on Discord. [@chipfucker](<https://discord.com/users/1184619891215573042>)
