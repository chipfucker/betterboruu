# Thanks for using BetterBooru!

BetterBooru *(currently mis-stylized as 'BetterBoruu' in most instances&mdash;I'll fix that eventually [if I don't come up with a more unique name](#alternative-name-ideas))* is an alternative frontend for most boorus that I designed for fun and for utility.

This is currently a huge work-in-progress; nothing is finished by any means.

This is also my first GitHub project, let alone my first GitHub Pages project, so things are bound to screw up one way or another while I use it. Please let me know if anything goes wrong on Discord. [@chipfucker](<https://discord.com/users/1184619891215573042>)
