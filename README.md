# Thanks for using BetterBooru!

BetterBooru *(currently mis-stylized as 'BetterBoruu' in most instances&mdash;I'll fix that eventually [if I don't come up with a more unique name](#alternative-name-ideas))* is an alternative frontend for most boorus that I designed for fun and for utility.

This is currently a huge work-in-progress; nothing is finished by any means.

This is also my first GitHub project, let alone my first GitHub Pages project, so things are bound to screw up one way or another while I use it. Please let me know if anything goes wrong on Discord. [@chipfucker](<https://discord.com/users/1184619891215573042>)

## Alternative name ideas

### Involving *Marlie,* my preferred name, and *booru*

* Maru
  * Ambiguous pronunciation; preferrably pronounced *mɑr u*
* Marbooru
  * Could confuse website as its own booru
* Maroo
  * Easy to tie to the 'skidamarink' song

### Involving *chip,* the first word in all of my usernames, and *booru*

* Chipbooru
  * Could confuse website as its own booru
* Chipboo
  * Could be confused or used as a nickname for *me*
* Choop
  * 'Gross word'
* Chipu 
  * Ambiguous pronunciation; preferrably pronounced 'ʧɪp u'
* Ruchip
  * 'Doesn't sound like it revolves boorus at all'

### Involving *the* and *booru*

* tBooru
  * Easy to mis-stylize
